# LeadMeHome

An iOS 10 & 11 tweak for locating an app from spotlight search. Just long press on the searched icon and it will take you to whatever folder it is in.
It works with nested folders and it allows customising animations and glow.

The code was written in couple days here and there on the run, don't poke my eyes out for mishaps.
Any questions about it, I can answer quickly on the JB Discord server where you can find me daily: https://discord.gg/3uev38a

-NOTICE: The below license allows for many things but you have to keep this in mind, I DO NOT PERMIT usage of this code in paid tweaks, copying the code -without crediting, etc. Any code you use from here it must be in an open sourced tweak (pay it forward). This code is open sourced for educational purposes -only. IF I DO catch anyone stealing code from here and breaking one of the above mentioned things, I will NEVER again open source another tweak of mine.
